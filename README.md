# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecom company through in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary focus is to uncover insights that can inform strategies to retain customers and improve long-term profitability, particularly by analyzing the influence of **payment methods** on customer churn.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer churn patterns with an emphasis on identifying relationships between churn and various customer features — especially the **method of payment** — in order to provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer lifetime value (CLTV).

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- The dataset consists of 7043 telecom customer records.
- Each record includes:
  - **Demographics** (e.g., gender, senior citizen)
  - **Service subscription details** (e.g., internet service, streaming)
  - **Payment information** (e.g., payment method, monthly charges)
  - **Customer churn status**

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA includes:

- **Data cleaning**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
- **Univariate analysis**: Understanding distributions (e.g., churn, senior citizen).
- **Bivariate analysis**: Comparing churn across key features.
- **Correlation study**: Identifying numerical features related to churn.
- **Visualization**: Count plots, bar graphs, and box plots for insights.

## 📌 Key Findings

### 1. **Churn Rate by Payment Method**
- **Electronic Check** users exhibit the highest churn rate: **45.8%**
- **Mailed Check** churn rate: **18.7%**
- **Bank Transfer (Auto)** churn rate: **16.7%**
- **Credit Card (Auto)** churn rate: **15.2%**

➡️ **Insight**: Customers using **automatic payments** are significantly more loyal.

---

### 2. **Behavioral Insight**
- Manual payments (electronic/mailed checks) are more prone to user error, payment delays, and service disruptions — leading to higher churn.
- Automated payments reduce friction, increase convenience, and promote continuity.

---

## 💡 Strategic Implications

- **Churn Reduction**: Transitioning manual payers to automatic billing can significantly reduce churn.
- **Cost Optimization**: Lower churn = improved LTV:CAC ratio = reduced pressure on marketing spend.
- **Controllable Lever**: Unlike immutable factors like age, payment method is **changeable** with the right nudge.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### 1. Transition to Auto-Pay

- Offer small incentives for enabling auto-pay (discounts, loyalty points).
- Promote uninterrupted service and reduced late fees as benefits.
- Include a **one-click auto-pay setup** during onboarding.

### 2. Targeted Retention Campaigns

- Focus on **Electronic Check** and **Mailed Check** users.
- Use personalized emails/in-app messages to encourage auto-pay adoption.
- Leverage behavioral nudges like:
  > “90% of customers like you use Auto-Pay for peace of mind.”

### 3. Build Trust and Awareness

- Add trust signals (🔒 Bank-level security, ✅ Most popular option).
- Educate customers through tutorials, tooltips, and support FAQs.
- Make the switch process as seamless and frictionless as possible.

---

## 🔎 Root Cause Hypotheses

- **Friction**: Manual billing requires more effort, leading to missed payments.
- **Tech comfort**: Older or less digital-savvy users may avoid auto-pay.
- **Awareness**: Some users may not know auto-pay is available or safe.
- **Trust**: Reluctance to save financial data online.
- **Satisfaction**: Dissatisfied customers delay or avoid paying.

---

## 📈 Conclusion

This analysis shows a **clear, actionable link** between payment method and churn risk. By addressing controllable user behaviors — especially how they pay — telecom companies can dramatically reduce churn, improve unit economics, and enhance customer satisfaction.
