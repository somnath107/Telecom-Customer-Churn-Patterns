# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Based on Payment Method

## 📌 Executive Summary

This report explores the relationship between customer churn and the **method of payment**, with the objective of identifying patterns that can help reduce attrition. Based on exploratory data analysis (EDA), we observed a significant disparity in churn rates across payment methods.

- **Electronic Check** users exhibit the highest churn rate at **45.8%**.
- In contrast, **automatic payment** users (via Bank Transfers or Credit Cards) have much lower churn rates, around **15–16%**.

These insights indicate that **payment behavior is a strong predictor of churn** and provide an actionable lever for customer retention. Nudging customers toward automatic billing methods can enhance **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** and ease the pressure on customer acquisition costs.
